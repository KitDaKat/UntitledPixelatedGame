# UntitledPixelatedGame
A dumb little game i made in unity.
It is more of a demo than a game.
Its quite laggy.

# ⚠️DISCLAIMERS⚠️
If you hit something you will start to tumble, just reset your game because idk how to fix that.
yes it's supposed to be low quality.
This is my first project on Unity and Github, so expect problems, and play it while keeping this in mind.

# Install instructions

Just go to the Unity project titled "Pixels1" then open it.

# Have fun!
