# UntitledPixelatedGame
A dumb little game i made in unity.
It is more of a demo than a game.
Its quite laggy.

# ⚠️DISCLAIMERS⚠️
yes it's supposed to be low quality.
This is my first project on Unity and Github, so expect problems, and play it while keeping this in mind.

# Install instructions

Just go to the Unity project titled Pixels[Version Number, find the latest one] then open it.

# Have fun!
